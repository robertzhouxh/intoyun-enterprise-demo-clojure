        Make sure this file is actually saved as UTF-8 encoding.
        Make sure how to check file encoding.
        English never has an encoding problem.
        However, when other languages are used, especially multi-byte
        characters, the problem often surfaces.
        If the encoding of meta tag and file's encoding are
        not the same, weird unreadable characters appear on the
        browser. Your browser may have encoding auto-detect feature
        and auto-correct outputs, though.
